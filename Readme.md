# snaplock

This project riffs off of the [Dynamo DB Golang samples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/dynamodb) and the [Serverless Framework Go example](https://serverless.com/blog/framework-example-golang-lambda-support/) to create an example of how to build a simple API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB set of methods.

## Code Organization
Note that, instead of using the `create_table.go` to set up the initial table like the AWS code example does, the resource building mechanism that Serverless provides is used.  Individual code is organized as follows:

* functions/post.go - POST method for creating a new item
* functions/get.go - GET method for reading a specific item
* functions/delete.go - DELETE method for deleting a specific item
* functions/put.go - PUT method for updating an existing item
* data/XXX.json - Set of sample data files for POST and PUT actions
* Makefile - Used for dep package management and compiles of individual functions
* serverless.yml - Defines the initial table, function defs, and API Gateway events

## Set Up
If you are a Serverless Framework rookie, [follow the installation instructions here](https://serverless.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-serverless-app/#setup).  If you are a grizzled vet, be sure that you have v1.26 or later as that's the version that introduces Golang support.  You'll also need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and it's dependency manager, [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

When both of those tasks are done, cd into your `GOPATH` (more than likely ~/go/src/) and clone this project into that folder.  Then cd into the resulting `snaplock` folder and compile the source with `make`:

```bash
$ make
dep ensure
env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/get functions/get.go
env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/post functions/post.go
env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/delete functions/delete.go
env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/put functions/put.go
env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/list-by-year functions/list-by-year.go
```
What is this makefile doing?  First, it runs the `dep ensure` command, which will scan your underlying .go files looking for dependencies to install, which it will grab off of Github as needed and place under a newly created `vendor` folder under `snaplock`.  Then, it'll compile the individual function files, placing the resulting binaries in the `bin` folder.

If you look at the `serverless.yml` file, it makes references to those recently compiled function binaries, one for each function in our service and each one corresponding to a different verb/path in our API we're creating.  Deploy the entire service with the 'sls' command:

```bash
$ sls deploy

Service Information
service: snaplock
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: snaplock-dev
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/movies/{year}
  GET - https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/movies/{year}/{title}
  POST - https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/staging
  DELETE - https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/movies/{year}/{title}
  PUT - https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/movies
functions:
  list: snaplock-dev-list
  get: snaplock-dev-get
  post: snaplock-dev-post
  delete: snaplock-dev-delete
  put: snaplock-dev-put
```

When done, you can find the new DynamoDB table in the AWS Console, which should initially look like this:

![Initial DynamoDB Table](/img/initialDynamoDBTable.jpg)

and your `<base URL>` will be of the format 'https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/movies' where `XXXXXXXXXX` will be some random string generated by AWS.

The development cycle would then be:

* Make changes to the .go files
* Run `make` to compile the binaries
* Run `sls deploy` to construct the service and push changes to lambda
* Use `curl` to then interrogate the API as described below

## Using
Once deployed and substituting your `<base URL>` the following CURL commands can be used to interact with the resulting API, whose results can be confirmed in the DynamoDB console

### POST

```bash
curl -X POST https:<base URL> -d @data/post1.json
```
Which should result in the DynamoDB table looking like this:

![First Post DynamoDB Table](/img/firstPostDynamoDBTable.jpg)

Rinse/repeat for other data files to yeild:

![All Posts DynamoDB Table](/img/allPostsDynamoDBTable.jpg)

### GET Specific Item
Using the year and title (replacing spaces wiht '-' or '+'), you can now obtain an item as follows (prettified output):
```bash
curl https://<base URL>/2013/Hunger-Games-Catching-Fire
{
  "year": 2013,
  "title": "Hunger Games Catching Fire",
  "info": {
    "plot": "Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.",
    "rating": 7.6
  }
}
```

### GET a List of Items
You can list items by year as follows (prettified output):
```bash
curl https://<base URL>/2013
[
  {
    "year": 2013,
    "title": "Hunger Games Catching Fire",
    "info": {
      "plot": "",
      "rating": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "year": 2013,
    "title": "Turn It Down Or Else",
    "info": {
      "plot": "",
      "rating": 0
    }
  }
]
```

### DELETE Specific Item
Using the same year and title specifiers, you can delete as follows:
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://<base URL>/2013/Hunger-Games-Catching-Fire
```
Which should result in the DynamoDB table looking like this:

![First Delete DynamoDB Table](/img/firstDeleteDynamoDBTable.jpg)

### UPDATE Specific Item
You can update as follows:
```bash
curl -X PUT https:<base URL> -d @data/put3.json
```
Which should result in the DynamoDB table looking like this:

![First Update DynamoDB Table](/img/firstUpdateDynamoDBTable.jpg)
